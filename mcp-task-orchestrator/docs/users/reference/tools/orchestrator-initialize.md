# orchestrator_initialize

Start a new task orchestration session with intelligent planning and specialist assignment.

#

# Overview

The `orchestrator_initialize` tool creates a new orchestration session, analyzes the task requirements, and sets up the workspace for execution. This is the starting point for all orchestrated workflows.

#

# Parameters

#

#

# Required Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `task_description` | string | Clear description of what you want to accomplish |
| `complexity` | string | Task complexity level: "basic", "intermediate", "advanced" |

#

#

# Optional Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `workspace_id` | string | auto-generated | Unique identifier for this workspace |
| `specialist_preferences` | array | auto-assigned | Preferred specialist roles to use |
| `context` | object | {} | Additional context or constraints |
| `deadline` | string | none | Time constraint for completion |

# Task Complexity Guidelines

#

#

# Basic Tasks

- Single component or script

- Well-defined requirements

- Minimal dependencies

- 1-2 hours of work

**Examples**: Bug fixes, simple utilities, documentation updates

#

#

# Intermediate Tasks

- Multiple components working together

- Some architectural decisions needed

- Moderate complexity

- 2-8 hours of work

**Examples**: Feature implementation, API integration, refactoring projects

#

#

# Advanced Tasks

- Complex system design

- Multiple phases or modules

- Significant planning required

- 1+ days of work

**Examples**: Full application development, system architecture, major migrations

#

# Best Practices

#

#

# Task Description Guidelines

✅ **Good Examples**:

- "Build a REST API for user management with authentication, CRUD operations, and SQLite database"

- "Refactor the payment processing module to use the Strategy pattern and add comprehensive tests"

- "Create a data pipeline that reads from Kafka, processes with pandas, and stores in PostgreSQL"

❌ **Poor Examples**:

- "Make my app better" (too vague)

- "Fix everything" (no specific scope)

- "Build a website" (missing requirements)

#

#

# Complexity Selection Tips

- **Start smaller**: Choose lower complexity if unsure

- **Consider dependencies**: External APIs increase complexity

- **Factor in unknowns**: Research tasks often become more complex

- **Plan for iteration**: Can always extend with additional orchestrations

#

#

# Context Best Practices

```text
json
{
  "context": {
    "existing_codebase": "Django REST API with PostgreSQL",
    "coding_standards": "Follow PEP 8, use type hints",
    "testing_requirements": "90% coverage, pytest framework",
    "deployment_target": "Docker containers on AWS ECS",
    "team_preferences": "prefer composition over inheritance"
  }
}

#

# Error Handling

#

#

# Common Errors

| Error Code | Description | Solution |
|------------|-------------|----------|
| `InvalidTaskDescription` | Description too vague or empty | Add specific requirements and goals |
| `UnsupportedComplexity` | Invalid complexity level | Use "basic", "intermediate", or "advanced" |
| `WorkspaceExists` | Workspace ID already in use | Choose different workspace_id or use existing |
| `InsufficientPermissions` | Can't create workspace directory | Check file system permissions |

#

#

# Validation Rules

- Task description: 10-1000 characters

- Complexity: Must be one of the three valid levels

- Workspace ID: Alphanumeric and hyphens only

- Specialist preferences: Must be valid specialist roles

#

# Integration with Other Tools

#

#

# Typical Workflow

1. **Initialize** → `orchestrator_initialize`

2. **Plan** → `orchestrator_plan` 

3. **Execute** → `orchestrator_execute`

4. **Monitor** → `orchestrator_status`

5. **Synthesize** → `orchestrator_synthesize`

6. **Complete** → `orchestrator_complete`

#

#

# State Management

- Session state is automatically saved to workspace database

- Can resume sessions after interruption

- Multiple sessions can exist simultaneously with different workspace IDs

#

# Performance Considerations

- Initialization typically takes 2-5 seconds

- Complex task analysis may take longer

- Database operations are atomic and consistent

- Workspace creation includes permission validation
