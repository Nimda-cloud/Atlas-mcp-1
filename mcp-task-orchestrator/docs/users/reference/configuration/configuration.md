# MCP Task Orchestrator - Configuration Guide

This guide explains how to configure and customize the MCP Task Orchestrator for your specific needs.

#

# Configuration Overview

The MCP Task Orchestrator uses several types of configuration:

1. **Client Configuration**: How MCP clients connect to the Task Orchestrator

2. **Specialist Templates**: Customizing the specialist prompts and roles

3. **Server Configuration**: General server settings and behavior

4. **Database Configuration**: State persistence and task tracking

#

# Client Configuration

The MCP Task Orchestrator CLI automatically configures your MCP clients during installation. Each client has a different configuration format and location:

#

#

# Claude Desktop

**Location**:

- Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

**Format**: Depends on Cursor's specific MCP implementation

#

#

# VS Code

**Location**:

- Windows: `%APPDATA%\Code\User\settings.json`

- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Code/User/settings.json`

- Linux: `~/.config/Code/User/settings.json`

**Format**: Depends on the VS Code MCP extension being used

#

# Specialist Templates

The MCP Task Orchestrator uses specialist templates to define the roles and prompts for different specialist types. You can customize these templates to better suit your needs.

#

#

# Template Location

Specialist templates are stored in the `config` directory of your installation:

- Default templates: `mcp_task_orchestrator/config/default_roles.yaml`

- Project-specific templates: `<project_directory>/*_roles.yaml`

The MCP Task Orchestrator will look for role definition files in the following order of precedence:

1. Project-specific role files (any file with a name ending in `_roles.yaml` in the project directory)

2. Default role file (`config/default_roles.yaml`)

This allows you to have different sets of specialist roles for different projects.

#

#

# Template Format

Specialist templates are defined in YAML format:

```text
yaml
specialists:
  architect:
    name: "System Architect"
    description: "Expert in system design and architecture planning"
    prompt_template: |

# Customizing Templates

To customize a specialist template:

1. Create a copy of the default template in your user directory:

   

```text
bash
   mkdir -p ~/.mcp_task_orchestrator
   cp mcp_task_orchestrator/config/specialists.yaml ~/.mcp_task_orchestrator/
   

```text
text
text

2. Edit the template to suit your needs:

   

```text
text
bash
   nano ~/.mcp_task_orchestrator/specialists.yaml
   

```text
text
text

3. Restart the MCP Task Orchestrator server for the changes to take effect

#

# Server Configuration

The MCP Task Orchestrator server can be configured using environment variables or a configuration file.

#

#

# Environment Variables

- `MCP_TASK_ORCHESTRATOR_DB_PATH`: Path to the SQLite database file (default: `~/.mcp_task_orchestrator/task_orchestrator.db`)

- `MCP_TASK_ORCHESTRATOR_CONFIG_DIR`: Path to the configuration directory (default: `~/.mcp_task_orchestrator`)

- `MCP_TASK_ORCHESTRATOR_LOG_LEVEL`: Logging level (default: `INFO`)

#

#

# Configuration File

You can create a `config.yaml` file in the configuration directory to override default settings:

```text
text
yaml

# Server configuration

server:
  name: "task-orchestrator"
  log_level: "INFO"

# Database configuration

database:
  path: "~/.mcp_task_orchestrator/task_orchestrator.db"

# Task configuration

tasks:
  max_subtasks: 10
  default_complexity: "moderate"

```text

#

# Database Configuration

The MCP Task Orchestrator uses SQLite for state persistence and task tracking. The database file is stored at `~/.mcp_task_orchestrator/task_orchestrator.db` by default.

#

#

# Database Schema

The database schema includes tables for:

- `tasks`: Parent tasks and their metadata

- `subtasks`: Individual subtasks and their relationships

- `specialists`: Specialist types and their templates

- `results`: Task results and artifacts

#

#

# Backup and Recovery

It's a good practice to periodically back up the database file:

```text
bash

# Create a backup

cp ~/.mcp_task_orchestrator/task_orchestrator.db ~/.mcp_task_orchestrator/task_orchestrator.db.backup

```text

To restore from a backup:

```text
bash

# Restore from backup

cp ~/.mcp_task_orchestrator/task_orchestrator.db.backup ~/.mcp_task_orchestrator/task_orchestrator.db

```text

#

# Advanced Configuration

#

#

# Custom Specialist Types

You can add your own specialist types by adding them to the `default_roles.yaml` file or creating a project-specific role file:

```text
yaml
my_custom_specialist:
  role_definition: "You are a Custom Specialist focused on..."
  expertise:
    - "Expertise area 1"
    - "Expertise area 2"
  approach:
    - "Approach step 1"
    - "Approach step 2"
  output_format: "Expected output format description"

```text

#

#

# Project-Specific Role Files

You can create project-specific role files to customize the specialist roles for a particular project. These files should be named with a suffix of `_roles.yaml` and placed in the project directory.

#

#

#

# Automatic Example File Creation

When the MCP Task Orchestrator is run in a directory without any role definition files, it will automatically create an `example_roles.yaml` file in that directory. This file contains a commented-out version of the default roles that you can use as a template for creating your own custom roles.

To use this example file:

1. Rename it to have a suffix of `_roles.yaml` (e.g., `project_roles.yaml` or `custom_roles.yaml`)

2. Uncomment and modify the sections you want to customize

3. Restart the MCP Task Orchestrator server

For example, to create a set of specialist roles for a web development project, you might create a file called `web_dev_roles.yaml` in your project directory:

```text
yaml

# Web Development Specialist Roles

task_orchestrator:
  role_definition: "You are a Web Development Task Orchestrator"
  expertise:
    - "Breaking down web development tasks into manageable subtasks"
    - "Assigning appropriate specialist roles to each subtask"
    - "Managing dependencies between web development components"
    - "Tracking progress and coordinating work"
  approach:
    - "Analyze the web development requirements and context"
    - "Identify logical components (frontend, backend, database, etc.)"
    - "Create a clear dependency structure between subtasks"
    - "Assign appropriate specialist roles to each subtask"
    - "Estimate effort required for each component"
  output_format: "Structured task breakdown with clear objectives, specialist assignments, effort estimation, and dependency relationships"
  specialist_roles:
    frontend_developer: "Building user interfaces and client-side functionality"
    backend_developer: "Implementing server-side logic and APIs"
    database_specialist: "Designing and optimizing database schemas"
    ui_designer: "Creating user interface designs and assets"
    tester: "Testing and validating web applications"

frontend_developer:
  role_definition: "You are a Senior Frontend Developer focused on building user interfaces"
  expertise:
    - "HTML, CSS, and JavaScript development"
    - "Frontend frameworks (React, Vue, Angular)"
    - "Responsive design and cross-browser compatibility"
    - "Web accessibility standards"
    - "Frontend performance optimization"
  approach:
    - "Build modular, reusable UI components"
    - "Ensure responsive design for all screen sizes"
    - "Optimize for performance and loading speed"
    - "Follow accessibility best practices"
    - "Write clean, maintainable code with proper documentation"
  output_format: "Well-structured frontend code with component documentation and usage examples"

# Additional specialist roles...

```text

When the MCP Task Orchestrator is run in a directory containing this file, it will use these custom roles instead of the default roles.

#

#

# Task Planning Customization

You can customize how tasks are broken down by modifying the task planning templates in the configuration file.
